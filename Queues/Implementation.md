Implementation of a queue:

Explanation of queues with a simple real-world example involving people waiting in line at a bus stop.

-Introduction to the Queue / The Queue Setup:
Queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first person (or item) to arrive is the first one to be served or processed - just like in a bus line

-Enqueuing (Adding to the Queue):
People join the queue when they arrive at the bus stop.
They stand at the end of the line and wait for the bus.

-Dequeuing (Removing from the Queue):
When the bus arrives, the driver opens the door and allows passengers to board in the order they arrived (FIFO).

-Peeking at the Front Passenger:
The driver may want to know who the next passenger is without letting them board yet.

-Checking If the Queue Is Empty:
After the bus departs, the queue may become empty as all passengers have boarded.
This is useful to determine if more passengers are waiting or if the service (the bus in this case) can close.
