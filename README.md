# â˜• java-dsa-practice

This folder contains my Java implementations and problem-solving practice for both DSA and Competitive Programming.  
My current prep is based on the following resources:

- ðŸ“˜ _Grokking Algorithms_ â€“ for clear DSA concepts and visual understanding  
- ðŸ“™ **CodeChef DSA Track** â€“ for Java-specific data structures, algorithms, and hands-on problems  
  - [Course link](https://www.codechef.com/learn/topic/data-structures-and-algorithms) â€“ topic-wise curated DSA content  
  - [Blog link](https://www.codechef.com/blogs/data-structures-in-java) â€“ detailed Java implementation guides

Problem-solving is reinforced through:

- **Leetcode** â€“ for structured, topic-wise DSA problems  
- **Codeforces** â€“ for logical reasoning, speed, and competitive programming strength (focusing on 800â€“1200 rated problems initially)
