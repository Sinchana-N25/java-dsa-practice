Graphs are versatile data structures used to model relationships between entities. They consist of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). Graphs can also be weighted (edges have associated values) or unweighted.

Node (or Vertex):
Nodes are used to depict individual entities or points in the context of the problem being modeled by the graph. Nodes can carry additional information, such as labels or attributes, depending on the application. In social networks, nodes might represent individuals, while in a road network, nodes might represent intersections.

Edge:
Edges represent relationships or connections between the entities represented by nodes. In an undirected graph, an edge is a two-way connection, whereas in a directed graph, edges have a specific direction from one node to another. Edges can also have weights, indicating the strength or cost of the connection. For example, in a transportation network, edges might represent roads, and the weight could represent the travel distance or time between two locations.
