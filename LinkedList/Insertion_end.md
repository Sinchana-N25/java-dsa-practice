**Insertion at end**

Insertion at end is fairly straightforward.

See the following steps:

Make a new node with the desired value.
Start at the head and move to the last node of the linked list.
Insert the new node after the last node.

The only edge case is when there is no value in the linked list. In that case, we set the head of the linked list to the new node.
