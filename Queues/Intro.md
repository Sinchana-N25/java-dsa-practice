A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science and software development.
It is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
Queues are commonly used to manage elements or tasks in a sequential order.

Key Characteristics of Queues:

-FIFO (First-In-First-Out): The element that has been in the queue the longest (at the front) is the next one to be processed or removed.
-Linear Data Structure: Elements in a queue are organized in a linear manner, typically from front to rear.

Two Primary Operations:
-Enqueue (or Offer): Adding an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
-Dequeue (or Poll): Removing and returning the element at the front of the queue.
Support for Peeking: You can examine the element at the front of the queue without removing it, using a "peek" operation.

Use Cases: Queues are used in various scenarios, such as task scheduling, managing requests in web servers, breadth-first search in graphs, and more.
