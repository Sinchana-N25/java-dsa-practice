Advantages
-The linked list can increase or decrease it's size whenever we need, so there is no need to set the size of a linkedlist before using it.
-Adding or removing elements in the middle of a linkedlist is a very simple task. We just need to change the links between nodes without moving other elements.
-In linked list we can move in forward and backward direction because each element knows about the one before and after it.

Disadvantages
-Finding an element in a linked list takes more time because we have to fo through the list from the start.
-In linked list each element stires extra information that's why it takes more memory.
